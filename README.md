# Carbon Tax Environment for Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project provides a Python environment for simulating a carbon tax policy scenario for reinforcement learning (RL) experiments. The environment allows RL agents to interact with a simulated economy affected by carbon emissions, expenses, revenue, and various policy actions.

## Features
- Simulates the effects of carbon tax, EV adoption, and solar panel installation on a company's financial state.
- Provides an RL-compatible environment with customizable observation and action spaces.
- Supports integration with RL libraries like OpenAI Gym.

## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carbon-tax-environment.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd carbon-tax-environment
    ```

### Usage
1. Import the `CarbonTaxEnvironment` class from `carbon_tax_environment.py` into your Python code.
2. Create an instance of the environment.
3. Use the environment's `step()` method to interact with the environment by passing actions and receiving observations, rewards, and episode termination signals.
4. Use the `reset()` method to reset the environment to its initial state.

Example usage:
```python
from carbon_tax_environment import CarbonTaxEnvironment

# Create environment
env = CarbonTaxEnvironment()

# Reset environment
state = env.reset()

# Simulate one step
action = 0  # Example action: Buy EV
new_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
```

### Customization
- Adjust parameters in the `CarbonTaxEnvironment` class constructor to customize the environment's behavior and simulation settings.
- Modify the action space, observation space, and state variables according to your RL problem requirements.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
